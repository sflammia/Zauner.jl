Once they have been computed their values are memoized and do not have to be recomputed.\n\nFrom the way that H is computed currently, K is not recognized as a subfield. This could lead to some non-intuitive results. For example, the quadratic generator a is an element of K, but not a recognized element of H. If an explicit embedding is needed, it can be obtained using is_subfield(K,H).\n\nExamples\n\njulia> AdmissibleTuple(5)\nAdmissibleTuple( d = 5, K = ℚ(√12), q = 1, Q = ⟨1,-4,1⟩, h = 1 )\n\njulia> AdmissibleTuple(11,3)\nAdmissibleTuple( d = 11, r = 3, K = ℚ(√5), q = 1, Q = ⟨1,-3,1⟩, h = 1 )\n\njulia> AdmissibleTuple(5,1,1)\nAdmissibleTuple( d = 4, K = ℚ(√5), q = 1, Q = ⟨1,-3,1⟩, h = 1 )\n\njulia> AdmissibleTuple(11,binary_quadratic_form(3,-12,4))\nAdmissibleTuple( d = 11, K = ℚ(√24), q = 2, Q = ⟨3,-12,4⟩, h = 2 )\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"functions/#Galois-groups","page":"List of Functions","title":"Galois groups","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"functions/","page":"List of Functions","title":"List of Functions","text":"centralizer_elements\ngalois_elements\ngalois_group_structure\ngalois_normal_form\ngalois_orbit\ngalois_order_orbit\nstabilizer_elements","category":"page"},{"location":"functions/#Zauner.centralizer_elements-functions","page":"List of Functions","title":"Zauner.centralizer_elements","text":"centralizer_elements(F::AdmissibleTuple)\n\nCompute the elements of mathrmGL(2mathbbZd) that are in the centralizer of the stability group for F.\n\nExamples\n\nThe centralizer for d=5 has 24 elements.\n\njulia> F = AdmissibleTuple(5);\n\njulia> cent = centralizer_elements(F);\n\njulia> length(cent)\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"functions/#Zauner.galois_elements-functions","page":"List of Functions","title":"Zauner.galois_elements","text":"galois_elements(F::AdmissibleTuple)\ngalois_elements(d::Integer, gens::Vector{Matrix{ZZRingElem}}, ords::Vector{Integer})\n\nCompute one element from each coset of mathcalMmathcalS where mathcalM is a maximal abelian subgroup of mathrmGL(2mathbbZd) and mathcalS is the stabilizer of F.

This list is conjecturally complete for all Weyl-Heisenberg covariant SICs in these dimensions. Each admissible tuple is specified by a dimension d and an integer binary quadratic form Q as follows. First factorize (d+1)(d-3)=s^2Delta_0 where Delta_0 is a fundamental discriminant. Then $ (d,Q) $ gives an admissible tuple if mathrmdisc(Q) = f^2Delta_0 where f divides s. The other columns can be computed from these data, but they may be difficult to compute, for example requiring integer factoring or finding a fundamental unit. The column Delta_0 contains the fundamental discriminant of Q and h is the order of the class group mathrmCl(mathcalO_f), given in the next two columns respectively. The Galois group mathrmGal(EK) of the field containing the overlaps over K=mathbbQ(sqrtDelta_0) is given in the next column. As both the class group and the Galois group are finite and abelian, we give the canonical decomposition into cyclic groups C_k of order k. For the special case that the tuple has so-called F_a symmetry, we have not yet worked out the Galois groups, so we mark these entries as tbd. The column L^n contains a generator L of the stability group of Q in mathrmGL_2(mathbbZ) and its order n in mathrmGL_2(mathbbZbard); that is, treating Q as a symmetric matrix we have L^T Q L = det(L) Q and L^n = 1 (bmod bard). If the tuple has antiunitary symmetry, we denote this with a Y in the a.u. column. Finally, ell is the length of the word expansion of L^n using the Hirzebruch-Jung (negative regular) reduction into the standard (S and T) generators of mathrmSL_2(mathbbZ). This is one measure of the complexity of constructing the actual fiducial vector for that input. The Q in this list were selected among class representatives to minimize this complexity, although this choice is not generally unique. The data here are sufficient to compute a ghost fiducial in each class, but to fully specify a SIC, one must additionally choose a sign-switching Galois automorphism sqrtDelta_0to-sqrtDelta_0 over an appropriate field extension of K.","category":"page"},{"location":"tables/","page":"Tables","title":"Tables","text":"d Delta_0 f h mathrmCl(mathcalO_f) mathrmGal(EK) Q L^n textau ell\n4 5 1 1 $ C_{1}
